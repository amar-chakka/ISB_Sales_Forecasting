Instructions to test the submissions:

Requirements: Jupyter Notebook in Google Colab Pro with Python 3.7. Rest of the libraries are defined in the file "requirements.txt" under the submitted folder.

Please make sure you have enough space in RAM available for this exercise. We had used Google Colab Pro for this.

Part I:

Data Exploration - Kindly check the notebook, "Data Exploration.ipynb"


Part II:

a. Predict weekly store sales for each product in a given store (80% weightage)

Kindly refer to the notebook, "Testing Utility.ipynb" and follow the below set of instructions:

1. Define the path to the three CSVs in the following variables:
    a. filepath_sales, filepath_prod_hierarchy and filepath_store_cities.
    Make sure the column names are same which were given initially.
2. Define the path to the pickle files shared in the submission folder in the following variables:
    a. filepath_outliers (model_outliers_isolation_forest.pkl), filepath_scaler (model_scaler.pkl), filepath_pca (model_pca_post_knee_plot.pkl), filepath_predictor (model_pca_post_knee_plot.pkl).
    All the pickle files are under "Pickles" folder.
3. Run the code snippets in the sequence.
4. Mean Squared Error would be displayed at the end of this notebook.

PS: The utility can extract features from date type fields, handle null values, encode categorical data, can handle outliers and can predict even on a subset of data.

PPS: In case of any errors, restart and clear the output and run the code again.
